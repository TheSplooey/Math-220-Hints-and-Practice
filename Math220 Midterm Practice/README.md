Practuce Midterm 1:
- Q4 may be quite unfair, but I felt that giving more hints might make the problem too trivial. I suppose if I were to give an additional hint without spoiling much, it would be to consider the elements of S as fractions and try multiplying things out.You will not find cancellations, but you will need to do something a bit sneaky (In particular, find precisely what q is). You definitely have everything you need to know to prove Q4.
- This sort of proofs where you have to "construct q" is common in mathematics, I do not expect anyone to get used to them in MATH 220 so I will avoid implementing too many of them.
- For Q5 if I were to mark this problem, I probably would not take points off for not using the inequality without proof, but I included the proof in the solutions in case anyone is curious. This would be a different story if I told you to explicitly prove the inequality too of course.
  
Practice Midterm 2:
- R+ means the positive real numbers.

Just keep practicing, everything will get easier.
