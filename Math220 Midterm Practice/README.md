- In practice midterm 1, Q4 may be quite unfair, but I felt that giving more hints might make the problem too trivial.
- I suppose if I were to give an additional hint without spoiling much, it would be to consider the elements of S as fractions and try multiplying things out.
- You will not find cancellations, but you will need to do something a bit sneaky. (In particular, find precisely what u is)
- You definitely have everything you need to know to prove Q4.
- This sort of proofs where you have to "construct u" is common in mathematics, I do not expect anyone to get used to them in MATH 220 so I will avoid implementing too many of them.
- Everything will get easier after practice.
