Practice Midterm 1:
- For Q2, be very careful about the logic when taking the contrapositive. The quantifiers come inside the P for P implies Q, unlike the usual case where the quantifiers lie outside P implies Q.
- Q4 may be quite unfair, but I felt that giving more hints might make the problem too trivial. I suppose if I were to give an additional hint without spoiling much, it would be to consider the elements of S as fractions and try multiplying things out.You will not find cancellations, but you will need to do something a bit sneaky (In particular, find precisely what q is). You definitely have everything you need to know to prove Q4.
- This sort of proofs where you have to "construct q" is common in mathematics, I do not expect anyone to get used to them in MATH 220 so I will avoid implementing too many of them.
- For Q5 if I were to mark this problem, I probably would not take points off for not using the inequality without proof, but I included the proof in the solutions in case anyone is curious. This would be a different story if I told you to explicitly prove the inequality too of course.
  
Practice Midterm 2:
- In Q3, R+ means the positive real numbers. R\Q means irrational numbers. I for irrational numbers is not really a convention outside of MATH 220.
- For Q4, you will want to be very careful about what you are proving. What you want to show is that if 1 = p1p2...pn, n is even. If 1 DOES NOT equal p1p2...pn when n is odd, your statement still holds. Your statement fails only when 1 = p1p2...pn AND n is odd.
- Some people might try proving the contrapositive in Q4 for the inductive step. I have tried it, and that will still eventually lead to a proof by cases in the inductive step since your inductive hypothesis would be "when n = k, if 1 = p1p2...pk then k is even", this does not guarantee that any product of the form p1p2...pk would be equal to 1 when k is even as that would be the converse of the statement (which is, by the way, false)

Just keep practicing, everything will get easier.
