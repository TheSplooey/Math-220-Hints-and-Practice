- You will not be expected to know the complex numbers nor Rn (Euclidean space) for your actual finals. I just assume that most of you probably know about them and hence I put them in Practice Finals 1.
- You will not be expected to know the Euclidean division of polynomials, but they are relatively similar to Euclidean division for integers so I put them in Practice Finals 2.
- You probably will not need to memorize the definition of a bounded sequence on the actual finals.
- MEMORIZE THE PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION, VERY COMMON FINALS QUESTION
