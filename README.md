- I tend to make practice tests or practice problem sets harder than what you would get in MATH 220, but I try not to make them unreasonably hard.
- These are more difficult than what you usually see in MATH 220 since there is already an abudance of material that contain problems similar to MATH 220 in its difficulty (See PLP, Book of Proof, How to Prove It)
- I give hints to homeworks but hopefully they won't be too obvious. I want to give hints on how to start thinking about the problem.
- You don't need to take the time limit in the practice tests too strictly. Being able to finish the practice tests in 1.5x the allocated time is already more than enough.
- Don't immediately look for hints and answers, that's an excellent way to not learn anything and will bite you HARD on tests. Work on problems on your own for a bit before seeking for help. That is not to discourage discussion of problems however.
- Also don't use generative AI for proofs, they suck ass, I will literally spank you and dump you into a firepit.
