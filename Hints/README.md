- The main goal of this is to help students get started with thinking about the problem, and point them in a direction to think.
- I will always encourage students to only look at the hints after they have worked at the problem at hand for a while.
- Looking at hints should not just give you a solution directly, you should still have to figure them out.
- If the hint is too easy, please let me know. I don't want to spoil the solutions for others.
