\subsection*{Hints to homework 4:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] You know from BÃ©zout's lemma that there exists $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $ax + by = 1$, so you can fix these variables. Try playing around with expressions by fixing $x$ and $y$.
\item[3.] Usually, multiply things out and simplifying expressions like $|\frac{2x^2}{2x^2 + 1}-2|$ will make things less confusing. 
\item[4.] You should think about what special properties sine have. It would be really nice if I can just somehow "delete" sine, or just not have to deal with it at all.
\item[5.] Since $x_n$ converges to 0, you can fix any arbitrary $\varepsilon_N > 0$ and you will get that for all $n > N$, $|x_n - 0 | \leq \varepsilon_N$. Notice $\set{x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_N}$ is a finite set.
\item[6.] What special properties do $(-1)^n$ have? What happens when $n$ is very big?
\end{enumerate}
(2) is pretty straight forward, just be careful.
