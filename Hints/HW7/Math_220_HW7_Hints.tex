\subsection*{Hints to homework 7:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.] You may want to try playing around with logical equivalences of the statements (for example, contrapositive). Drawing pictures might help you visualize too.
\item[6.] What equivalence class does $e$ belong to and how would it look like? What about $e^2$ and so on? What elements do these equivalence classes have in common and not havei n common?
\end{enumerate}
1,3,4,5 are pretty straightforward, play around with the definitions a bit, and for Q1 you may want to write out the elements of $\mathcal{P}(\set{1,2})$. An additional note would be that for proofs involving symmetry and transitivity, it suffices to prove $aRb$ implies $bRa$ since the choice of $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary at the beginning of your assumption (You start the proof with "Let $a,b \in A$").
