Modular Arithmetic is not the most accurate title. 
A lot of the content relates to modular arithmetic but could also just be some elementary number theory
i.e. usage of BÃ©zout's lemma or proving some very simple number theory results.
In Q8, we will only prove the case for when 1 <= a <= p-1, 
but this also follows for any a in Z that is not divisible by p due to Euclidean division
so proving this small case will already suffice.
