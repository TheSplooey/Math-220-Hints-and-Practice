This is a reading package for group theory, which is at a more advanced level than 220. The content can be confusing and is mostly for those who are interested in reading about how more advanced maths would look like. Knowledge up to chapter 7 will be sufficient even though the exercises may be more demanding beyond the content of the chapter. Group theory is the beginning of modern algebra andis attributed to Ã‰variste Galois who was working on studying the solvability of polynomials, and groups are one of the simplest algebraic structures. Yet, they show up ubiquitously in math in symmetries of objects, roots of polynomials, and more advanced algebraic structures such as rings, modules, fields, and vector spaces are built upon groups. Groups also show up in physics which is interconnected with Lie theory, in chemistry when discussing symmetry of objects, and are the founding basis of cryptography, error correction code, and much of modern machine learning. As such, they are an important mathematical object to study, and also a pretty interesting and fascinating one.
